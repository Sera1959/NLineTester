# NLineTester
Scripts for testing NLines also called Newcamd in C# and Java

Currently they don't work, so any help is appreciated

CSharp code is based on this documentation: https://3color.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cardservproxy/etc/protocol.txt

Java is based on the CSP source code:

and http://www.infosat.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=13
