# NLine tester scripts
*Also called Nline, Ncamd, Newcamd and NewCam*

Scripts for testing that a NLine works or not. Currently in C# and Python.

I made them as some people host line-testing websites and reject to share their source code.
With those scripts you can program your own testing website/software and be sure that **nobody steals your lines** :)

#### Check this repository for a Cline (CCcam) tester: https://github.com/DaggerES/CLineTester

Please, share your code!!!!
